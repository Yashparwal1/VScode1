/* 
Is strings a Datatype in C? -- NO
Strings is not a supported datatype in C but it is very useful concept to model the real world entities like name, city etc.
We express strings using an array of characters terminated by a null character ('\0'). 

What are Strings in C ? 
* String is an array of characters terminated by NULL character.
* Inshort, Strings are null terminated arrays.
* String in C is created by creating an array of characters.
* We need extra character ('\0' or null character) to tell the compiler that the string ends here.
