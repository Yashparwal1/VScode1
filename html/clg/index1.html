            We know that a computer stores data internally in a format that is not easily readable by human brings. This is the reason why input and output (I/O) interfaces  are required. Every computer stores nukbers, letters, and other special characters in coded form. Before going into the details of these codes, it is essential to have a basic understanding of Number system. Hence this chapter familarizes you with the fundamentals of number system. It also introduces some commonly used number system by computer professionals and relationship among them.</p>

        <p style="font-size: 22px">
            In early days, humans used to count things on fingers and when counting beyond 10 fingers, they used stones, pebbles, or sticks to indicate values. This method of counting uses additive approach or <i><b>non-positional number</b></i> system. In this system we have symbols such as I for 1, II for 2, III for 3 etc. Each symbol represents the same value regardless of its position in a number, and to find the value of a number. One has to count the number of symbols present in the number. Since it is very difficult to perform arithmetic with such number system, positional number systems were developed.

        <p style="font-size: 22px">
            In <i><b>positional number</b></i> system there are only a few symbols called digits. These symbols represents different values, depending on the position they occupy in a number. The value of each digit in such a number is determined by three considerations:
            <ol type="1">
            <li>The digit itself</li>
            <li>The position of the digit in the number, and</li>
            <li>The base of the number system (where <i>base</i> is defined as the total numbers of the digits available in the number system).</li>
            </ol>
