            <h1>Describe Cloud Computing</h1>
            <p>Microsoft Azure is a cloud computing platform with an ever-expanding set of services to help you build
                solutions to meet your business goals. Azure services support everything from simple to complex. Azure
                has simple web services for hosting your business presence in the cloud. Azure also supports running
                fully virtualized computers managing your custom software solutions. Azure provides a wealth of
                cloud-based services like remote storage, database hosting, and centralized account management. Azure
                also offers new capabilities like artificial intelligence (AI) and Internet of Things (IoT) focused
                services.</p>
            <p>In this series, you’ll cover cloud computing basics, be introduced to some of the core services provided
                by Microsoft Azure, and will learn more about the governance and compliance services that you can use.
            </p>

            <h2>What is Azure Fundamentals?</h2>
            <p>Azure Fundamentals is a series of three learning paths that familiarize you with Azure and its many
                services and features.
            <p>Whether you're interested in compute, networking, or storage services; learning about cloud security best
                practices; or exploring governance and management options, think of Azure Fundamentals as your curated
                guide to Azure. </p>
            <p> Azure Fundamentals includes interactive exercises that give you hands-on experience with Azure. Many
                exercises provide a temporary Azure portal environment called the sandbox, which allows you to practice
                creating cloud resources for free at your own pace.</p>
            <p> Technical IT experience isn't required; however, having general IT knowledge will help you get the most
                from your learning experience.</p>
            <hr>
            <h2>What is Cloud Computing</h2>
            <p>Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services over the internet. Computing services include
                common IT infrastructure such as virtual machines, storage, databases, and networking. Cloud services
                also expand the traditional IT offerings to include things like Internet of Things (IoT), machine
                learning (ML), and artificial intelligence (AI).</p>
            <p>Because cloud computing uses the internet to deliver these services, it doesn’t have to be constrained by
                physical infrastructure the same way that a traditional datacenter is. That means if you need to
                increase your IT infrastructure rapidly, you don’t have to wait to build a new datacenter—you can use
                the cloud to rapidly expand your IT footprint.</p>
            <hr>
            <h2>Describe the shared responsibility model</h2>
            <p>Start with a traditional corporate datacenter. The company is responsible for maintaining the physical
                space, ensuring security, and maintaining or replacing the servers if anything happens. The IT
                department is responsible for maintaining all the infrastructure and software needed to keep the
                datacenter up and running. They’re also likely to be responsible for keeping all systems patched and on
                the correct version.</p>
            <p>With the shared responsibility model, these responsibilities get shared between the cloud provider and
                the consumer. Physical security, power, cooling, and network connectivity are the responsibility of the
                cloud provider. The consumer isn’t collocated with the datacenter, so it wouldn’t make sense for the
                consumer to have any of those responsibilities.</p>
            <p>At the same time, the consumer is responsible for the data and information stored in the cloud. (You
                wouldn’t want the cloud provider to be able to read your information.) The consumer is also responsible
                for access security, meaning you only give access to those who need it.</p>
            <p>Then, for some things, the responsibility depends on the situation. If you’re using a cloud SQL database,
                the cloud provider would be responsible for maintaining the actual database. However, you’re still
                responsible for the data that gets ingested into the database. If you deployed a virtual machine and
                installed an SQL database on it, you’d be responsible for database patches and updates, as well as
                maintaining the data and information stored in the database.</p>
            <p>With an on-premises datacenter, you’re responsible for everything. With cloud computing, those
                responsibilities shift. The shared responsibility model is heavily tied into the cloud service types
                (covered later in this learning path): infrastructure as a service (IaaS), platform as a service (PaaS),
                and software as a service (SaaS). IaaS places the most responsibility on the consumer, with the cloud
                provider being responsible for the basics of physical security, power, and connectivity. On the other
                end of the spectrum, SaaS places most of the responsibility with the cloud provider. PaaS, being a
                middle ground between IaaS and SaaS, rests somewhere in the middle and evenly distributes responsibility
                between the cloud provider and the consumer.</p>
            <p>The following diagram highlights how the Shared Responsibility Model informs who is responsible for what,
                depending on the cloud service type.</p>

                alt="shared responsibility model">
            <p>You will always be responsible for:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The information and data stored in the cloud</li>
                <li>Devices that are allowed to connect to your cloud (cell phones, computers, and so on)</li>
                <li>The accounts and identities of the people, services, and devices within your organization</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The cloud provider is always responsible for:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The physical datacenter</li>
                <li>The physical network</li>
                <li>The physical hosts</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Your service model will determine responsibility for things like:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>OS</li>
                <li>Network Controls</li>
                <li>Appliations</li>
                <li>Identity and Infrastructure</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Define Cloud Models</h2>
            <p>What are cloud models? The cloud models define the deployment type of cloud resources. The three main
                cloud models are: private, public, and hybrid.</p>
            <h2 style="font-size: 20px; color: yellow;">Private Cloud</h2>
            <p>Let’s start with a private cloud. A private cloud is, in some ways, the natural evolution from a
                corporate datacenter. It’s a cloud (delivering IT services over the internet) that’s used by a single
                entity. Private cloud provides much greater control for the company and its IT department. However, it
                also comes with greater cost and fewer of the benefits of a public cloud deployment. Finally, a private
                cloud may be hosted from your on site datacenter. It may also be hosted in a dedicated datacenter
                offsite, potentially even by a third party that has dedicated that datacenter to your company.</p>
            <h2 style="font-size: 20px; color: yellow;">Public Cloud</h2>
            <p>A public cloud is built, controlled, and maintained by a third-party cloud provider. With a public cloud,
                anyone that wants to purchase cloud services can access and use resources. The general public
                availability is a key difference between public and private clouds.</p>
            <h2 style="font-size: 20px; color: yellow;">Hybrid Cloud</h2>
            <p>A hybrid cloud is a computing environment that uses both public and private clouds in an inter-connected
                environment. A hybrid cloud environment can be used to allow a private cloud to surge for increased,
                temporary demand by deploying public cloud resources. Hybrid cloud can be used to provide an extra layer
                of security. For example, users can flexibly choose which services to keep in public cloud and which to
                deploy to their private cloud infrastructure.</p>
            <p>The following table highlights a few key comparative aspects between the cloud models.</p>
            <table aria-label="Cloud Model" class="table">
                <thead>
                    <tr>
                        <th><strong>Public Cloud </strong></th>
                        <th><strong>Private Cloud </strong></th>
                        <th><strong>Hybrid Cloud </strong></th>
                    </tr>
                </thead>
                <tbody>
                    <tr>
                        <td>No capital expenditures to scale up</td>
                        <td>Organizations have complete control over resources and security</td>
                        <td>Provides the most flexibility</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Applications can be quickly provisioned and deprovisioned</td>
                        <td>Data is not collocated with other organizations’ data</td>
                        <td>Organizations determine where to run their applications</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Organizations pay only for what they use</td>
                        <td>Hardware must be purchased for startup and maintenance</td>
                        <td>Organizations control security, compliance, or legal requirements</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Organizations don’t have complete control over resources and security</td>
                        <td>Organizations are responsible for hardware maintenance and updates</td>
                        <td aria-label="No value"></td>
                    </tr>
                </tbody>
            </table>
            <h2 style="font-size: 20px; color: yellow;">Multi Cloud</h2>
            <p>A fourth, and increasingly likely scenario is a multi-cloud scenario. In a multi-cloud scenario, you use multiple public cloud providers. Maybe you use different features from different cloud providers. Or maybe you started your cloud journey with one provider and are in the process of migrating to a different provider. Regardless, in a multi-cloud environment you deal with two (or more) public cloud providers and manage resources and security in both environments.</p>
            <h2 style="font-size: 20px; color: yellow;">Azure Arc</h2>
            <p>Azure Arc is a set of technologies that helps manage your cloud environment. Azure Arc can help manage your cloud environment, whether it's a public cloud solely on Azure, a private cloud in your datacenter, a hybrid configuration, or even a multi-cloud environment running on multiple cloud providers at once.</p>
            <h2 style="font-size: 20px; color: yellow;">Azure VMware Solutions</h2>
            <p>What if you’re already established with VMware in a private cloud environment but want to migrate to a public or hybrid cloud? Azure VMware Solution lets you run your VMware workloads in Azure with seamless integration and scalability.</p>

            <h2>Describe the consumption-based model</h2>
            <p>When comparing IT infrastructure models, there are two types of expenses to consider. Capital expenditure (CapEx) and operational expenditure (OpEx).</p>
            <p>CapEx is typically a one-time, up-front expenditure to purchase or secure tangible resources. A new building, repaving the parking lot, building a datacenter, or buying a company vehicle are examples of CapEx.</p>
            <p>In contrast, OpEx is spending money on services or products over time. Renting a convention center, leasing a company vehicle, or signing up for cloud services are all examples of OpEx.</p>
            <p>Cloud computing falls under OpEx because cloud computing operates on a consumption-based model. With cloud computing, you don’t pay for the physical infrastructure, the electricity, the security, or anything else associated with maintaining a datacenter. Instead, you pay for the IT resources you use. If you don’t use any IT resources this month, you don’t pay for any IT resources.</p>
            <p>This consumption-based model has many benefits, including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>No upfront costs.</li>
                <li>No need to purchase and manage costly infrastructure that users might not use to its fullest potential.</li>
                <li>The ability to pay for more resources when they're needed.</li>
                <li>The ability to stop paying for resources that are no longer needed.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>With a traditional datacenter, you try to estimate the future resource needs. If you overestimate, you spend more on your datacenter than you need to and potentially waste money. If you underestimate, your datacenter will quickly reach capacity and your applications and services may suffer from decreased performance. Fixing an under-provisioned datacenter can take a long time. You may need to order, receive, and install more hardware. You'll also need to add power, cooling, and networking for the extra hardware.</p>
            <p>In a cloud-based model, you don’t have to worry about getting the resource needs just right. If you find that you need more virtual machines, you add more. If the demand drops and you don’t need as many virtual machines, you remove machines as needed. Either way, you’re only paying for the virtual machines that you use, not the “extra capacity” that the cloud provider has on hand.</p>
            
            <h2>Compare cloud pricing models</h2>
            <p>Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services over the internet by using a pay-as-you-go pricing model. You typically pay only for the cloud services you use, which helps you:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Plan and manage your operating costs.</li>
                <li>Run your infrastructure more efficiently.</li>
                <li>Scale as your business needs change.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>To put it another way, cloud computing is a way to rent compute power and storage from someone else’s datacenter. You can treat cloud resources like you would resources in your own datacenter. However, unlike in your own datacenter, when you're done using cloud resources, you give them back. You’re billed only for what you use.</p>
            <p>Instead of maintaining CPUs and storage in your datacenter, you rent them for the time that you need them. The cloud provider takes care of maintaining the underlying infrastructure for you. The cloud enables you to quickly solve your toughest business challenges and bring cutting-edge solutions to your users.</p>
